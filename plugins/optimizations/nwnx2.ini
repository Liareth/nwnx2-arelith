[OPTIMIZATIONS]

; hooks/TickRate
;   Set this to 1 to limit server AI updates per second.
hook_tick_rate=1

;   Server tick rate. Timing is adjusted on the fly so that the main loop
;   runs at most this many times per second.
;   - 10 is quite laggy
;   - 16 is "okay-but-laggy-dont-eat-my-cpu"
;   - 33 is perfectly fine for smaller servers
;   - 50 is very good
;   - 100 is bioware default and probably excessive.
;    Values > 100 will not take effect due to how the mainloop works.
;
;   If you are afflicted with performance cargo culting, try to pick a rate that
;   spreads evenly over 10ms/11ms intervals.
tick_rate_target_high=33

;   Tickrate the server should run at when idle/no players are online.
;   (Note: this will NOT affect player login delays and network latency,
;    just game world updates.)
;   If you set it lower than 3 or so, you might not give your server enough
;   time to even run module heartbeats on a frequent basis. Experiment.
;   (Hint: You can even set this to 0 to completely suspend all server
;    activity while no player is online, but be aware that it will NOT stop
;    timers. Use pause_server_when_empty for that instead.)
tick_rate_target_low=3

; Optional/experimental stuff below! Might break stuff!

; hooks/AIActionSit
;   Tweak AIActionSit to not run if the creature in question is already sitting
;   on the desired chair. This is a potential huge cost in cputime if you have
;   many sitting creatures, since each one triggers a Line of Sight check.
hook_ai_action_sit=1

; Additional list of tweaks always active:

; hooks/RunScriptCallback
;   removes a dummy function that does nothing but eat cpu cycles with each
;   script invocation

; hooks/HrTimer
;   replaces the global High Resolution timer with one that only updates
;   every mainloop iteration instead of on each call
