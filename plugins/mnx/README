MINIMAL NETWORK EXTENSION (MNX) Plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

nwnx_mnx.so: minimal network extention.  Plugin that sends UDP
messages to UDP listening servers.

Request= NWNX!MNX!OPEN!SERVICENAME!  Parameters= hostname:port
Request= NWNX!MNX!CLOSE!SERVICENAME!  Parameters= n/a
Request= NWNX!MNX!SEND!SERVICENAME!  Parameters= message

Optionally, you may add a section to nwnx2.ini:
[MNX]
service=MYSERVICENAME			# your service name
hostname=localhost:1234			# the host to throw UDP packets at

mnx.pl: UDP listening server in perl.  Listens to 2182 and returns the
output from the date command.  Port and Cmdline are adjustible in the
source.

plugin-t: standalone test application.  Scans the CWD for any files
that match 'nwnx_*.so' (case sensitive) and tries to load, query and
initialize the CNWNXBase object contained within.

nwnxtest.mod: module that opens a connection to localhost:2182 (click
on the book).  Click on the book to exercise the MNX plugin.  The
spirit to your left is my admin console work-in-progress (talk to him
to see what happens to non admins :)
